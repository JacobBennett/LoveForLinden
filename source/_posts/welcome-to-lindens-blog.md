Laura and I were talking recently and realized just how much we had forgotten during Linden's journey over the last year. We wanted to have a place to recognize and record God's grace and the unmerited favor he has shown us during her journey also provide a way to keep family and friends up to date on Linden's progress towards transplant.

Thanks for taking the time to care about and show **love for Linden** ;)
