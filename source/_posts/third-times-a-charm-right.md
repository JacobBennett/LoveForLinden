After being readmitted on Friday, we found out that Linden has rhinovirus, which is a very common respiatory virus. While for you and I the common cold is no biggie, for Linden it means a fever, higher biliruben and liver enzymes, and a visit to the hospital. It's a bummer to be readmitted for a second time, but a blessing they were able to find a source to her fever. Another infection could have been very serious for Linden. We were discharged about 1:15 on Saturday and happy to be on our way home with a pidly virus and **so so** ready to spend our Saturday with Graham. 


###And then....

Linden was due for her second dose of IV antibiotics at 3:30. We scrubbed up and prepared all of the supplies. Jake began by trying to pull back (clean) the line and nothing was coming out of her picc. Not good. He tried again and all he was able to pull back was air. Shoot! We knew this wasn't good, so we called our home health agency and they sent a nurse. The nurse came and she also wasn't able to pull anything back or push anything through the line. Linden's picc line was occluded, which meant she wasn't able to get her much needed antibiotics (she had already skipped her afternoon dose), and we knew the probable solution....readmission. 

The home health nurse called our (favorite) doctor and he made some phone calls. We were to head to the ED in Peoria, where we would meet the crisis nurse from peds. She would work her magic and try to get the picc working again. 
That is just what we did. We arrived at the ED around 8:30 and were back in the room with the crisis nurse by 9:00. She did her very best to fix the line but was unsuccessful. She broke the news to us that we were going to be readmitted. I won't lie and say I was calm, cool, and collected. There were definitely some tears. I'm so thankful for supportive family and friends who are able to be a voice of reason and speak truth into me while going through another hospital admission.

The crisis nurse was very nice and got us out of the ED (it's pretty much a zoo on weekends) ASAP and up to our room. We waited around for awhile and by 11:00 they were poking Linden for another IV---they got it in on the second try and this time in her little footie. :( Poor girl hates being held down for IV's, it's heartbreaking. We were all ready for bed at this point and were conked out by midnight. 

Linden slept like a champ, which is a huge battle won. I know many of you were praying for a good nights rest so thank you. 


###The Plan...

The plan is to wait for the picc team to assess her picc line. There's a few things that can do before having to pull the whole thing and start new. Unfortnately the picc team isn't in on the weekends so we are here until tomorrow. The doctor who is on call this weekend is really pulling for us and has already left a message for the team so they can try and schedule us as early as possible tomorrow morning. Praying that's the case. 


###Prayer Requests...

Of course **LINDEN**....she has been such a trooper, but is very tired and ready to bust out of this hospital. 

**GRAHAM**....He is starting to vocalize missing us and wondering why it's always  \"mommy, daddy, mommy, daddy.\" It's been heartbreaking appearing and disappearing from his life over the past week. We are trying to make his time away from us fun and special. Pray that he would continue to be resilient to all of this.

**PICC SCHEDULE**...Pray the picc team is able to get us scheduled in the morning tomorrow. Also, that the problem can be fixed without inserting a whole new line.

**NPO**....Linden won't be able to eat or drink again for 8 hours. I think it may be a form of torture to keep a one year old from eating for 8 hours. 

**CINCINNATI**....On Tuesday night we are heading to Cincinnati for Linden's last appointment before being listed. Please pray for endurance for us. We are very tired, but know this appointment needs to happen. It will be a full day of tests, which can be tiresome for all. While we are anxious for her to be listed, this past week has been emotionally and physicall exhausting and we anticipate Wednesay being the same. We are praying and expecting **grace upon grace** from our heavenly Father. 

Thanks for the prayers and love shown to our family. 

>**Psalm 18** — God’s way is perfect. All the Lord’s promises prove true. He is a shield for all who look to him for protection. For who is God except the Lord? Who but our God is a solid rock? God arms me with strength, and he makes my way perfect. He makes me as surefooted as a deer, enabling me to stand on mountain heights.He trains my hands for battle;he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.You have given me your shield of victory.Your right hand supports me; your help has made me great.
You have made a wide path for my feet to keep them from slipping.
