                    <p>Linden was wheeled into pre-op about 8:30 this morning sleeping on Laura&#039;s shoulder, out like a light. They gave her a few sedatives and the nurses whisked her off to the bowels of the hospital to do their magic. Our transplant nurse was able to get us a huge…</p>

                    <p>Linden&#039;s second appointment at Cincinnati Childrens was scheduled for this Wednesday, so Tuesday night we packed up the car and the kiddos and set out for the land of the Buckeyes. We arrived about 8:30 PM after watching Frozen three times in a row and eating lots of snacks…</p>

I&#039;m actually typing this on the way to Cincinnati, but we&#039;re not at the hospital anymore, and we were sleeping in our own beds last night, so that&#039;s good enough for me! Long story short, we…</p>

                    <p>After being readmitted on Friday, we found out that Linden has rhinovirus, which is a very common respiatory virus. While for you and I the common cold is no biggie, for Linden it means a fever, higher biliruben and liver enzymes, and a visit to the hospital. It&#039;s a bummer…</p>

We had a PICC line scheduled for 2:00 PM and although Linden wouldn&#039;t be able to eat from 6:00 AM until then, the prospects of heading home after a long few days at the hospital made it all worth it. Thankfully, Linden…</p>
